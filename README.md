# Genotify

---

Genotify is a light-weight, cross-platform desktop application for quick gene annotations. If you're a researcher, you likely find yourself Googling gene names relatively frequently, especially when doing a heavy lit review or poring through spreadsheets of differentially expressed genes. 

This program aims to give you access to all of the resources you could ever want for a gene, from links to all of the major databases to functional summaries and references. Hopefully it does it well.
