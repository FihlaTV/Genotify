# Genotify

---

Genotify is a light-weight, cross-platform desktop application for quick gene annotations. If you're a researcher, you likely find yourself Googling gene names relatively frequently, especially when doing a heavy lit review or poring through spreadsheets of differentially expressed genes. **Genotify** provides up-to-date gene info without opening a browser. Simply copy a gene name, ID, or symbol to your clipboard and use `ctrl+q` (or `cmd+q`) to query for that gene. Limit by species if you so desire. Click any of the resulting text boxes to copy them to your clipboard.

This program aims to give you access to all of the resources you could ever want for a gene, from links to all of the major databases to functional summaries. Hopefully it does it well.

## Installation

Just download the release for your OS, unzip, and run. To build from source with `node.js`, you can just clone the repo and do the typical `npm install` followed by `npm start`.

## Usage

Genotify is dead simple to use. Type a query into the search box and click the search button, hit enter, or use the hotkey `ctrl+q` (or `cmd+q`) to query from clipboard. Read what said gene does. Select a species from the list to limit the search to that species. Fin.

## Issues/Comments
Hit up the issues pages here and drop a line. I'm usually pretty quick to respond. I'm also open to suggestions for new features.
